**Letâ€™s roll up our sleeves!**

Software development is a process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software. It involves three basic types of software: system software, programming software, and application software. System software provides core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management, and other operational necessities. Programming software gives programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers, and other tools to create code. Application software (applications or apps) helps users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media players, and security programs are examples of application software.

## Our service:

DssFactory can provide service of designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing.

1. Requirements gathering: This phase involves gathering the needs and requirements of the software users.
2. Design: This phase involves creating the blueprint for the software, including the user interface, the data structures, and the algorithms.
3. Coding: This phase involves writing the source code for the software.
4. Testing: This phase involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected.
5. Deployment: This phase involves making the software available to the users.
6. Maintenance: This phase involves fixing bugs and adding new features to the software.

## How do we work:

- **Development**: In this phase, developers write and test code in a collaborative environment.
- **Integration**: The code is integrated into a shared repository, and automated tests are run to ensure that the code is functional.
- **Testing**: The code is tested continuously to ensure that it meets the required quality standards.
- **Monitoring**: The application is monitored continuously to identify and resolve issues before they become critical.
- **Delivery**: The application is deployed to production in a continuous manner, ensuring that new features are delivered quickly and efficiently.
- **Deployment**: The application is automatically deployed to production without any manual intervention.
- **Feedback**: Feedback is collected from users and stakeholders, which is used to improve the application.
