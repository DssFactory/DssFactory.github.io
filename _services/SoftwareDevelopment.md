DssFactory can analyze variety type of data:

Software development is a process of creating, designing, deploying, and supporting software. It involves three basic types of software: system software, programming software, and application software. System software provides core functions such as operating systems, disk management, utilities, hardware management, and other operational necessities. Programming software gives programmers tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers, and other tools to create code. Application software (applications or apps) helps users perform tasks. Office productivity suites, data management software, media players, and security programs are examples of application software.

## Our service:

DssFactory can provide service of designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing

1. Requirements gathering: This phase involves gathering the needs and requirements of the software users.
2. Design: This phase involves creating the blueprint for the software, including the user interface, the data structures, and the algorithms.
3. Coding: This phase involves writing the source code for the software.
4. Testing: This phase involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected.
5. Deployment: This phase involves making the software available to the users.
6. Maintenance: This phase involves fixing bugs and adding new features to the software.

## How do we work:

- **Version control system**: Track changes to the code. This will help you to keep track of the changes you have made and to revert to a previous version if necessary.
- **Bug tracking system**: Track bugs and issues. This will help you to prioritize the bugs and to track their progress.
- **Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline**: Automate the testing and deployment of the software. 
- **Feedback and maintenance**: After the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance.
