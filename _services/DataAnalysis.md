Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, in different business, science, and social science domains.

The data analysis process typically moves through several iterative phases:

1. `Define the business question`. What do you want to learn from the data?
2. `Collect the data`. This can be done through surveys, interviews, experiments, or other methods.
3. `Clean the data`. This involves removing errors and inconsistencies from the data. Transform the data. This involves converting the data into a format that is suitable for analysis. Model the data. This involves using statistical or machine learning techniques to find patterns in the data. Interpret the results. This involves explaining what the results mean and how they can be used to answer the business question.
The data analysis process can be complex and time-consuming, but it can be a valuable tool for making informed decisions.
