**Let's model the world!**

Numerical simulation involves using mathematical models to replicate the behavior of a physical system. It serves as a valuable tool for studying systems that are too complex or costly to analyze through experiments. The outcomes of these simulations offer insights into the systemâ€™s behavior and can also be used to predict how the system will behave under various conditions.

## How do we work:

- **Define the problem**: The first step is to define the problem that you want to solve. This includes identifying the system that you want to model, the variables that you want to study, and the conditions that you want to simulate.
- **Develop a mathematical model**: The next step is to develop a mathematical model of the system. This model will typically be based on a set of partial differential equations that describe the behavior of the system.
- **Solve the mathematical model**: The mathematical model can be solved using numerical methods. These methods typically involve discretizing the system into a finite number of elements, and then solving the equations for each element.
- **Validate the model**: Once the model has been solved, it is important to validate the model. This means checking that the model produces results that are consistent with experimental data or theoretical predictions.
- **Use the model**: Once the model has been validated, it can be used to study the behavior of the system. This can be done by running the model under different conditions and observing the results.
