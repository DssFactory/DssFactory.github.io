DssFactory has participated in projects where numerical simulations with all of the following software packages were performed:
- DHI 
- Deltares D and G software
- USACE HEC software
- EPA pipe hydraulics EPANET and sewer systems SWMM software

We make use of different standards and libraries for diverse file formats
- OpenFM
- OpenDA
- OpenCV
- HDF
- netCDF

In some projects DssFactory has delivered the necessary input for numerical simulation, or the visualization of results of large numerical simulations. If necessary, we can also build the numerical simulation within a cloud service such as Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure.
