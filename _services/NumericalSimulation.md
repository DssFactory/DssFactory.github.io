**DssFactory can build complex simulation models**

Numerical simulation is the use of mathematical models to simulate the behavior of a physical system. It is a powerful tool that can be used to study systems that are too complex or too expensive to study experimentally. The results of the numerical simulations can be used to gain insights into the behavior of the physical system. They can also be used to make predictions about the system's behavior under different conditions.

## Our service:

DssFactory has experience in Computational Fluid Dynamics. This type of simulation can be used to study the behavior of fluids in pipes, channels, and other systems.

1. Water distribution network
2. Fluvial, estuarine and coastal environments

## How do we work:

- **Define the problem**: The first step is to define the problem that you want to solve. This includes identifying the system that you want to model, the variables that you want to study, and the conditions that you want to simulate.
- **Develop a mathematical model**: The next step is to develop a mathematical model of the system. This model will typically be based on a set of partial differential equations that describe the behavior of the system.
- **Solve the mathematical model**: The mathematical model can be solved using numerical methods. These methods typically involve discretizing the system into a finite number of elements, and then solving the equations for each element.
- **Validate the model**: Once the model has been solved, it is important to validate the model. This means checking that the model produces results that are consistent with experimental data or theoretical predictions.
- **Use the model**: Once the model has been validated, it can be used to study the behavior of the system. This can be done by running the model under different conditions and observing the results.
