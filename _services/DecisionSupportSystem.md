**Let's make our choice!**

A Decision Support System (DSS) is an interactive, software-based tool designed to assist decision-makers by integrating data, documents, expert knowledge, and business models to identify issues and support informed decision-making. It combines analytical models with data retrieval capabilities, emphasizing user-friendly interfaces for those without technical expertise. DSS platforms are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing them to evolve with changing environments and user needs.

## Our service:

DssFactory supports decision-makers by delivering valuable information and in-depth analysis, enabling more informed and effective choices.

1. Model-driven DSS: These DSSs use mathematical models to represent the problem being solved. The models are used to generate solutions to the problem.
2. Data-driven DSS: These DSSs use data to make decisions. The data is used to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions or decisions.
3. Knowledge-driven DSS: These DSSs use expert knowledge to find the best solution. The knowledge is used to search experiences for the problem.
4. AI-driven DSS: These DSSs use Artificial Intelligence to suggest innovated solution. 

## How do we work:

- **Problem identification**: DSS can be used to help identify problems that need to be solved.
- **Data analysis**: DSS can be used to analyze data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Modeling**: DSS can be used to develop mathematical models of the problem being solved.
- **Sensitivity analysis**: DSS can be used to analyze the sensitivity of solutions to changes in the data or the model.
- **Decision making**: DSS can be used to help decision makers make decisions by providing them with information and analysis.
