DssFactory can provide customized Decision Support System

A Decision Support System (DSS) is interactive software-based systems intended to help decision-makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions. DSS attempts to combine the use of models or analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions. DSS specifically focuses on features that make them easy to use by non-computer-proficient people in an interactive mode, and DSS emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to accommodate changes in the environment and the decision-making approach of the user.

## Our service:

DssFactory can help decision makers to make better decisions by providing them with information and analysis. Thus decision makers can save time and money by our service.

1. Model-driven DSS: These DSSs use mathematical models to represent the problem being solved. The models are used to generate solutions to the problem.
2. Data-driven DSS: These DSSs use data to make decisions. The data is used to identify patterns and trends that can be used to make predictions or decisions.
3. Knowledge-driven DSS: These DSSs use expert knowledge to find the best solution. The knowledge is used to search experiences for the problem.
4. AI-driven DSS: These DSSs use Artificial Intelligence to suggest innovated solution. 

## How do we work:

- **Problem identification**: DSS can be used to help identify problems that need to be solved.
- **Data analysis**: DSS can be used to analyze data to identify patterns and trends.
- **Modeling**: DSS can be used to develop mathematical models of the problem being solved.
- **Sensitivity analysis**: DSS can be used to analyze the sensitivity of solutions to changes in the data or the model.
- **Decision making**: DSS can be used to help decision makers make decisions by providing them with information and analysis.
