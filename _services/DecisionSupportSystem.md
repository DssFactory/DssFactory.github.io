A Decision Support System (DSS) is interactive software-based systems intended to help decision-makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents, and personal knowledge, or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.

They tend to be aimed at the less well-structured, underspecified problem that upper-level managers typically face. DSS attempts to combine the use of models or analytic techniques with traditional data access and retrieval functions. DSS specifically focuses on features that make them easy to use by non-computer-proficient people in an interactive mode; and DSS emphasizes flexibility and adaptability to accommodate changes in the environment and the decision-making approach of the user.
