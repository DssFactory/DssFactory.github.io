# Decision Support System Factory

We are developing a Decision Support System (DSS) for early warning and forecasting that leverages remote sensing data along with cutting-edge hydraulic, hydrodynamic, and meteorological modelsâ€”utilizing freely available software. To enhance its accuracy and efficiency, we also incorporate advanced AI technologies into the system.

## Mission

Our company focuses on creating tailored solutions that integrate principles from physics, data mining, and information and communication technologies (ICT). We aim to deliver innovative technologies to address water-related challenges across diverse sectors. Although our framework can be applied beyond water issues, this remains the core of our technological development and primary area of expertise. We work in close collaboration with specialists in hydraulics, hydrology, hydroinformatics, ecoinformatics, bioinformatics, and other advanced technological fields.

## Vision

Our goal is to become a leading provider of information and communication technologies for addressing water resource challenges. We are committed to supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by extending our global impact and collaborating within a network of organizations focused on the interconnected issues of water, food, and energy
