We develop a Decision Support System (DSS) for early warning and forecasting systems that uses remote sensing data and state-of-the-art hydraulic, hydrodynamic, and meteorological models, available as freeware. We also integrate advanced AI technologies into the DSS to improve its accuracy and performance.

## Mission

The company aims to develop customized solutions that combine physics, data mining, and ICT concepts. We want to provide technological solutions for water related problems in various areas. While our framework is not limited to water problems, it is the focus of our technological development and our main area of expertise. We collaborate with experts in hydraulics, hydrology, hydroinformatics, ecoinformatics, bioinformatics, and other cutting-edge technologies.

## Vision

We aim to be a leading company in information and communication technologies for water resources problems. We believe that we can contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by having a global reach and by being part of a network of organizations that are working together to address the nexus of water, food, and energy.
