A web-based decision support system (DSS) is a software application that helps users make informed decisions through data analysis, modeling, and visualization—accessible via a web browser.

- Web-based: It runs on a server and is accessed through a web browser, so users don’t need to install anything locally.
- Decision Support System: It combines data, models, and user-friendly interfaces to help people analyze complex problems and make better decisions.

## Our Solution
