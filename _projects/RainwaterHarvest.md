## Intro

Rainwater harvesting is the process of collecting, storing, and using rainwater for various purposes, rather than letting it run off. Itâ€™s a sustainable water management practice that can help reduce dependence on municipal water supplies and improve water availability, especially in areas with limited resources.

## Solution

DssFactory developed an Android app that incorporates meteorological data to estimate the potential for rainwater harvesting worldwide.
